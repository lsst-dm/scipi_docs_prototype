    This task assembles sections of an image into a larger mosaic.  The sub-sections
    are typically amplifier sections and are to be assembled into a detector size pixel grid.
    The assembly is driven by the entries in the raw amp information.  The task can be configured
    to return a detector image with non-data (e.g. overscan) pixels included.  The task can also 
    renormalize the pixel values to a nominal gain of 1.  The task also removes exposure metadata that 
    has context in raw amps, but not in trimmed detectors.

    
How to call with options/flags
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The primary method of this Task is *assembleCcd*.  If you run the example below, *runAssembleTask.py*, you will find what it does in the *main* method is call another method inside of it, *runAssembler*.  What this does in turn is set up the config params for the *assembleTask* class, then initialize an *assembleTask* obj.

It then shows you how this Task works for 2 situations: where there is no variation between a set of amps, and where there is.  In the case where there isn't, it simply makes up one img (an ExposureF obj, via the utility class *exampleUtils.py*, found in the same examples dir; to construct this, first the *makeAssemblyInput* method of this class is called, which then calls *makeAmpInput* and finally the *makeExpFromIm* function), and then passes it back.  If there is an actual set of amps, it makes a dict object, with the key being the amp name, and the value being an ExposureF obj for each key, and passes this back.  Once back in *runAssembleTask.py*, it makes the final product, also an ExposureF obj, via::

            assembledExposure = assembleTask.assembleCcd(assemblyInput)

Then *assembleCcd* knows how to put together the final obj, an ExposureF obj, testing for either case, and it passes this back.

(And *runAssembleTask.py* then actually displays both imgs by default in a 2 frame ds9 window that it opens.)

Debugging
+++++++++ 

The command line task interface supports a flag -d to import debug.py from your PYTHONPATH; see Using lsstDebug to control debugging output for more about debug.py files.

The available variables in AssembleCcdTask are:

- display -- A dictionary containing debug point names as keys with frame number as value. Valid keys are:

- assembledExposure -- display assembled exposure

Examples
++++++++

This code is in runAssembleTask.py in the examples subdir (of $IP_ISR_DIR).

(It runs fully successfully on the 4/2016 stack -- though the current version is having probs with the 11/2016 stack, see Jira tikt DM-8355.)

Specific functions of class
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

assembleCcd
-----------

Assemble a set of amps into a single CCD size image.

postprocessExposure
-------------------

Set exposure non-image attributes, including wcs and metadata and display exposure (if requested)

setGain
-------

Renormalize, if requested, and set gain metadata

setWcs
------

Set output WCS = input WCS, adjusted as required for datasecs not starting at lower left corner


What it returns
+++++++++++++++

assembledCcd â€“ An *lsst.afw.image.Exposure* of the assembled amp sections.
