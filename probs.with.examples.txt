Problem running photoCalTask.py example script from $PIPE_TASKS_DIR/examples

hi all- as part of my writing documentation for various DM Tasks, I'm working through some of the examples in the Tasks (as listed on the doxygen pages), and though some work straight off, others are not doing so, and I'm posting one of the first of those here in case it's a real issue.  The photoCalTask.py example script is supposed to exercise at least both AstrometryTask and FitTanSipWcsTask.

Also NB: I'm testing on 2 versions of the stack, an old one (from April 2016) and a recent one, so in case it helps diagnose any, I'll give both versions of the errors I'm finding.  

So, on the Princeton Tiger-Sumire machine, after doing:

```source /tigress/HSC/LSST/stack_20160915/eups/bin/setups.sh
setup miniconda2
setup lsst_apps ```

doing out of the box `python photoCalTask.py` (this is using python ver 2.7.11) yields on the current stack:

``` CameraMapper INFO: Unable to locate registry registry in root: /tigress/HSC/LSST/stack_20160915/Linux64/meas_astrom/12.1-3-gb143333+21/tests/data/sdssrefcat/registry.sqlite3

Problem running calibTask.py example script from $PIPE_TASKS_DIR/examples

hi all- as part of my writing documentation for various DM Tasks, I'm working through some of the examples in the Tasks (as listed on the doxygen pages), and though some work straight off, others are not doing so, and I'm posting one of the first of those here in case it's a real issue.  The calibTask.py example script is supposed to exercise both CalibTask and CharacterizeImageTask.

Also NB: I'm testing on 2 versions of the stack, a very old local one (from April 2016) and a recent one, which is the one that matters most, so that's the one from which I'll report the error.  (In this case, the example actually runs fine locally).


So, on the Princeton Tiger-Sumire machine, after logging in and doing:

```source /tigress/HSC/LSST/stack_20160915/eups/bin/setups.sh
setup miniconda2
setup lsst_apps ```

then going to $PIPE_TASKS_DIR/examples and running out of the box `python photoCalTask.py` (this uses by default python ver 2.7.11 btw), yields the below, which indicates some problem with a file possibly being moved?  (The schema subdir in fact doesn't exist at all).
