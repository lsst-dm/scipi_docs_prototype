Writing Task Topics
###################

This page describes how to document science pipelines tasks for the `pipelines.lsst.io <https://pipelines.lsst.io>`_ documentation project.

.. _task-topics-usage:

Using the template
==================

We provide a standardized template for all task documentation pages.
This required template ensures consistency and style, and also provides you tools for automatically extracting documentation from your code.

You can obtain the template from :doc:`here <template-for-tasks>`.

.. _task-topics-install:

Installing the template
-----------------------

To install the template, copy it into the `doc/tasks` directory of your stack package. Then name the file after the task class, with a `.rst` extension.
For example: `doc/tasks/ProcessCcdTask.rst`.

.. _task-topics-instructions:

Filling out the template
------------------------

The template includes brief instructions as reStructuredText comments.
Each component of the documentation page is described in more detail on this page, below.


.. _task-topics-title:

Titling the Page
================

The title of the page should be the name of the task class (*ProcessCcdTask*, for example).


.. _task-topics-summary:

Summary/context (1-2 sentences)
===============================
Write this section concisely, as it should be very brief, and is primarily about whether the reader should choose to use this task to achieve h/her goal in a very quick scan.

For example, for `ProcessCcd` we might write:

.. code-block:: rst

   ProcessCcdTask is a command line task which executes the processing
   steps to turn raw pixel-level data into characterized images and
   calibrated catalogs.

.. _task-topics-logic:
	  
Summary of logic/algorithm
==========================
This should be done in just a paragaph and/or a bullet list.
Be concise and link to other tasks wherever needed.
This can be a few more sentences, but should not contain very many details or math at this point (that will go in the algorithmic section at the bottom).
It should just say where this fits into the larger DM structure, what retargetable subtasks or methods within a task it calls by default.

For example, for `ProcessCcd` we would give a list of the 3 subtasks that `ProcessCcd` invokes to do its job.  For another example, for `IsrTask` we might say:

.. code-block:: rst
		
   Instrument Signature Removal (ISR) is a sequence of steps taken to
   correct the effects imprinted on the counts coming out of the readout
   by the physical characteristics of the detector and the electronics of
   the readout chain.  It is generally the very first procedure carried
   out on the pixel-level data of an exposure.
	  
If there are optional tasks that are called you can choose to fill those in here as well, but note them as optional and depending on whether a flag is set in the configuration parameters

.. _task-topics-module:

Module membership
=================
Here, simply state the module the task is implemented inside of, filling in the required line in the template.

For example, for `ProcessCcd`

.. code-block:: rst

   This task is implemented in the `lsst.pipe.tasks <taskModules.html#pipetasks>`_ module.

.. _task-topics-seealso:
	   
"SeeAlso" box
=============
The API Usage page for this task will automatically be linked to in this box, but please fill in the following types of tasks and pages into this section:

  - Tasks that commonly use this task (this helps a reader
    landing on a subtaskâ€™s page find the appropriate driver
    task).     
  
  - Tasks that can be used instead of this task (to link families of subtasks).   

  - Pages in the **Processing** and **Frameworks** sections of the Science Pipelines documentation.

  - The API Usage page for this Task

In the case of `ProcessCcd`, we would simply say is called as a `command line task`, where for e.g. IsrTask, we would say that that it is most commonly called by `ProcessCcd`.

.. _task-topics-config:	  

Configuration
=============
The guidance here we give is how to describe configuration flags inside the codebase itself, as they will be picked up automatically and populated into this page.


.. _task-topics-retarg:

Retargetable Subtasks
---------------------
The guidance here we give is how to describe retargetable subtasks inside the codebase itself, as they will be picked up automatically and populated into this page.

.. _task-topics-params:
   
Parameters
----------
The guidance here we give is how to describe parameters inside the codebase itself, as they will be picked up automatically and populated into this page.

.. _task-topics-python:
   
Python usage
============

.. _task-topics-initzn:

Class initialization
--------------------
The guidance here we give is how to describe the class initialization and the parameters of the signature inside the codebase itself, as this will all be picked up automatically and populated into this page.

.. _task-topics-run:
	  
Run method
----------
The guidance here we give is how to describe the run method and the parameters of its signature inside the codebase itself, as this will all be picked up automatically and populated into this page.

.. _task-topics-debug:

Debugging
=========
The guidance here we give is how to describe debugging flags inside the codebase itself, as they will be picked up automatically and populated into this page.

.. _task-topics-examples:
   
Examples
========

Making a good example can be a substantial job which requires writing the actual code and then going through and describing line by line in comments inside it to explain what the example is doing.  

The example should be very stripped down and use only the basic functionality of the task.  It should also be self-contained, allowing a user to follow a few steps to exercise the task. Any data and configuration should be included in the example.

To give some specific guidance, we will give a few pointers for how one might write an example for IsrTask, which we will call `exampleIsrTask.py`, then describe it with reST.

In some cases, we might want to write a separate local `utilities.py` class which will contain some some utility functions which are normally spread found in other packages.
By writing them locally, we can allow the user to inspect the functions immediately without going far afield for them.

Next, we describe some of the details for the content of `exampleIsrTask.py`.

Where needed, when describing any part of code, including task configuration, the python code block directive can be used as so:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. code-block:: python

      #Create the isr task with modified config
      isrConfig = IsrTask.ConfigClass()
      isrConfig.doBias = False #We didn't make a zero frame
      isrConfig.doDark = True
      isrConfig.doFlat = True
      isrConfig.doFringe = False #There is no fringe frame for this example
		   
Then, to describe the block setting up configuration parameters, we can say in reST:

.. code-block:: rst
		
   The first line: ``isrConfig = IsrTask.ConfigClass()`` indicates this is
   a section about setting up the configuration that the code will be run
   with.  The next several set up specific flags, indicating that we will
   not do bias or fringing corrections in this code, but will do the dark
   and flat corrections.

We can then describe the other intermediate sections in ways similar to the above, saying that the final output is created with the call to the `IsrTask` `run` method:

.. code-block:: python
		
   output = isrTask.run(rawExposure, dark=darkExposure, flat=flatExposure)


.. _task-topics-algorithm:
   
Algorithm details
=================

This should be written in detailed form and can refer to prior written documentation as long as it is accessible by all potential code users.
Mathematical notation can be used here and written in LaTeX through the :rst:directive:`math directive <sphinx:math>` of reST, for details on this see `the reStructuredText Style Guide <https://developer.lsst.io/docs/rst_styleguide.html#rst-math>`_ .

Here is an example of the syntax for inserting an equation (from IsrTask):

.. code-block:: rst

   :math:`Ic(x) = I(x) + {1 \over 2} {d \over dx} \left[ I(x) {d \over dx} \int K(x-y) I(y) dy  \right]` 		
  
Which will render as:

:math:`Ic(x) = I(x) + {1 \over 2} {d \over dx} \left[ I(x) {d \over dx} \int K(x-y) I(y) dy  \right]`
