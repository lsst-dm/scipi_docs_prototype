Name of the processing context.

Context
=======

This component briefly establishes the topic’s context:

- Explain what the processing context means in non-jargon language. What data goes in? What data comes out?

- Link to adjacent processing contexts. For example, a single frame processing topic should mention and link to the data ingest topic.

- Mention and link to the main command line tasks used in this context.

- Suggest and link to an introductory tutorial for this processing context.



In Depth
========

This section lists and links to separate topic pages. Each of these self-contained topics provide in-depth background into aspects of processing in this context.

The first in depth topic should be an ‘Overview’ that describes the processing context itself, and introduces other in-depth topics and tutorials.

Many of these topics can be divided into two halves: processing data in this context, and measuring objects from the products of that processing.

Processing topic pages have the flexibility to organize in depth topics (and tutorials, below) around themes like this.

Tutorials
=========

The Tutorials section links to tutorial topic pages that demonstrate processing real datasets in this context. These tutorials should be easily reproduced and run by readers; necessary example datasets should be provided.


Command line tasks
==================

This final section in a processing topic lists all command line tasks associated with that processing context. Links to task topics.
