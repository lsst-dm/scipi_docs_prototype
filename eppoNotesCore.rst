EPPO - the basic core
=====================

- His goal is to say: this is the best, vs. other systems, so there's a lot of info theory detail at times

- Also: aimed commercially, but we can adapt for our work

- Much psych study in it - why we write books (sec 1) -- info scent and foraging

- EPPO is essentially: Wiki, horizontal vs. hierarchical

- People find things by search: see sec. 3.2, fig 3.1 and 3.2

- Workflow: separate page, vs. a TOC (fig 4.1 in sec 4, then Figs 5.1, 5.2 in sec 5)

- Also, pathfinder/big picture topics are impt (sec 15)

- 'Topic type' templates are very impt (sec 9)
    
- Each page *does* need context (sec 10, and 5)

- Graphics as context-setters (sec 10)

- Be limited in each topic (sec 8)

- Decision support (sec 8.7)

- Tools for structured writing (sec 18)

  - rhetorical and computable s.w.
    
- List of args for EPPO (sec 22)

  ---------- Extra:

- Videos as topics (sec 14.6)
