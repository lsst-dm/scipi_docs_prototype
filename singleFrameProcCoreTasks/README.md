# scipi_docs_prototype

Prototype for doing docs for the DM code structure (written in reST).

If you'd like to see the results, clone the repo, build from within the dir using 'make html' (this does assume you have sphinx installed), and look at it locally in dir: 

   file:///[dir you cloned to]/_build/index.html
