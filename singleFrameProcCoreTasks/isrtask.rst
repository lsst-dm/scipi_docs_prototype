IsrTask 
#######

Instrument Signature Removal (ISR) is a sequence of steps taken to
'clean' images of various aspects of defects that any system of optics
and detectors will imprint on an image by default, and is generally
one of the very first procedures carried out on an exposure.

In more detail, though the process for correcting imaging data is very
similar from camera to camera, depending on the image, various of the
defects will be present and need to be removed, and thus the sequence
of steps taken will vary from image to image.  Generally these
corrections are done one CCD at a time, but on all the amplifier
sub-images at once for a CCD.  

IsrTask provides a generic vanilla implementation of doing these
corrections, including the ability to turn certain corrections off if
they are not needed.

This task is implemented in the `lsst.ip.isr`_ module.

Butler Inputs
=============

`dataRef` â€“ a `daf.persistence.butlerSubset.ButlerDataRef <#>`_ of the
detector data to be processed

The inputs to the entrypoint method are the exposure to be corrected
(which will be of `datasetType <#>`_ `raw <#>`_) and the calibration
data products. The raw input is a single chip-sized mosaic of all amps
including overscans and other non-science pixels.

Butler Outputs
==============

Exposure of `datasetType <#>`_ `postISRCCD`.

Examples
========

To see an example of the ISR algorithm in action, run the
example in the `$IP_ISR_DIR/examples` as follows:

.. code-block:: python
		
  python  runIsrTask.py --write --ds9

The optional `--write` flag tells the code to write the post-ISR image
file to disk.  In this example code, this output file is called::

   postISRCCD.fits

The optional `--ds9` flag tells it to bring up the ds9 image viewer (if installed) and show the post-ISR image.

As an overview: what this example does after setting up the
parameter configuration, is to make several calibration exposures
that will be used to create the final corrected output exposure.
Finally, the output is produced by using the `run`_ function of `IsrTask`, after
ingesting the raw exposure and the calibration exposures and
processing them.


Stepping through the example:

First the task is imported along with `exampleUtils.py`, a local
modification of `utils.py` which will provide some needed utility
functions:

.. code-block:: python
		
  from lsst.ip.isr import IsrTask
  import exampleUtils

Next, a function `runIsr` is defined which sets several config parameters as so:

.. code-block:: python
		
    #Create the isr task with modified config
    isrConfig = IsrTask.ConfigClass()
    isrConfig.doBias = False #We didn't make a zero frame
    isrConfig.doDark = True
    isrConfig.doFlat = True
    isrConfig.doFringe = False #There is no fringe frame for this example

The first line indicates this is a section about setting up the
configuration that the code will be run with.  The next several set up
specific flags, indicating that we will not do bias or fringing
corrections in this code, but will do the dark and flat corrections.

Next, several parameters that will be used to make the raw, flat and
dark exposures are defined, using knowledge of our camera and exposures::

    DARKVAL = 2.0      # Number of electrons per sec
    OSCAN = 1000.      # DN = Data Number, same as the standard ADU
    GRADIENT = 0.10
    EXPTIME = 15       # Seconds for the science exposure
    DARKEXPTIME = 40.0 # Seconds for the dark exposure

Next, the 3 calibration exposures that we will be using in this
example to create the final corrected output exposure are created
using the functions in the extra included utility file::

    darkExposure = exampleUtils.makeDark(DARKVAL, DARKEXPTIME)
    flatExposure = exampleUtils.makeFlat(GRADIENT)
    rawExposure = exampleUtils.makeRaw(DARKVAL, OSCAN, GRADIENT, EXPTIME)

Finally, the output is produced with the line::

       output = isrTask.run(rawExposure, dark=darkExposure, flat=flatExposure)

And returned at the end of the function.

(The `main` function of runIsrTask simply calls this runIsr
function, and as noted earlier, also brings up ds9 to view the final
output exposure if that flag is set on, and writes the image to disk
if that flag is set.)
	    

Debugging
=========

- `display` - A dictionary containing debug point names as keys with frame number as value.  The only valid key is:

  `postISRCCD` (to display exposure after ISR has been applied)

See `lsstDebug.info`_ for more on the debugging framework.

.. _`lsstDebug.info`: https://lsst-web.ncsa.illinois.edu/doxygen/x_masterDoxyDoc/classlsst_debug_1_1_info.html

Algorithm details
====================

IsrTask performs instrument signature removal on an exposure in varying ways depending on which corrections need to be applied to the raw image, but generally some combination of the following is done:

- Finding out which pixels have charge which overfills their potential wells

- Bias subtraction: removing the pedestal introduced by the instrument for a zero-second exposure (may use the overscan correction function)

-   Dark correction: i.e. removing the dark current, which is the residual current seen even when no light is falling on the sensors

-   Flat-fielding: i.e. correcting for the different responsivity of the current coming from pixels to the same amount of light falling on them

- Apply brighter fatter correction: i.e. accounting for the distortion of the electric field lines at the bottom of pixels when bright objects liberate many charges that get trapped at the bottom of the potential wells

- Mask known bad pixels, defects, saturated pixels and all NaNs and interpolate over them
