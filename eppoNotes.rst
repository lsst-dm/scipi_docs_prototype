Chapter 5. Information Architecture Bottom Up
-----------------------------------------

Paper encyclopedias have to be ordered alphabetically or topically, but ask how Wikipedia is ordered, and the question proves to be absurd. Wikipedia isn’t ordered either topically or alphabetically. It is not ordered at all. It is connected.


------ 5.1.  A web of subject affinities

However, links can help enormously. Following a link is less disruptive than doing a search and creates less cognitive overhead. As long as the link is to a useful resource, it makes life easier for your readers. Links also help keep readers inside your content set, as opposed to letting them wander off across the Web (which they are free to do even if your content isn’t on the Web).

--- Manicouagan Crater articl

the contributing authors have created a good context-setting opening paragraph with strong links along the lines of subject affinity.

the footer is confined to those aspects of the taxonomy that are related to the subject affinities of the article itself. This turns the article into a hub of its immediate area in its subject space, the crossroads of a semantic cluster.


------- 5.2. Irregular subject affinities

Any two-dimensional presentation of organizational relationships (on paper or on a screen) will, by necessity, flatten them.

 Mercator projection

 Perspective Drawing

 Isomorphic Drawing

In text and online, we have built a civilization and a science on the flattening of information.  But these restrictions belong to an age in which the predominant tool for the extension and sharing of our intellect was paper.

 Computers and, perhaps more importantly, computer networks, are not dimensionally restricted in the way paper is. They allow us to represent and explore worlds and problems in multiple dimensions. We can represent a multidimensional world in the computer’s memory and create algorithms to represent that world without distortion. We no longer have to flatten to represent. We no longer have to flatten to understand

The imprecision inherent in tagging is about accepting the natural messiness of the world

 But we now have the ability to allow readers to rotate their view and, through linking, traverse the information space along multiple axes,


---------- 5.6.  Broader, deeper, more dynamic

if the Web is a collection of filters, the navigational schema of your website is just one more filter out of the many filters that may return (or reject) individual pages of your content. It is likely that visitors reach your pages (not your site) using some filter other than your site’s top-down navigation. Consequently, your ability to influence, help, and retain visitors begins on that page, and starting from that page, their navigation will be bottom up.

We need to break away from the top-down organizational schema of the book world and learn to adopt, create, and manage a bottom-up organizational schema that supports an information collection as vast, vibrant, and fluid as the Web.

----------- 5.7. Should we abandon top-down navigation?

No -- some visitors will arrive at your home page and attempt to navigate your site. You need to accommodate these visitors, too.

One of the great things about bottom-up navigation is that, because it is distributed, and always local in the context of any regular page, it is also largely unobtrusive and should work well within any top-down framework.

In the presence of good bottom-up navigation, top-down navigation does not have to be comprehensive to be effective. You can avoid the scary monster TOC and still provide effective access to all of your content.

Every Page is Page One is not about pitting one means of navigation against another.  You just need to write that page as if it were page one.

------------- 5.8. The role of lists

In Section 4.3, “Curriculum versus classification” we saw that most books attempt to prescribe a curriculum for readers, whereas an EPPO topic generally assumes readers will construct the curriculum.

Lists are common on the Web and can be considered a type of Every Page is Page One topic.
3A list is open ended.  Lists can provide a connective layer between higher- and lower-level topics.


Chapter 6. What is a Topic?
-----------------------------------------

The challenge for writers is to produce effective Every Page is Page One topics with a strong information scent.

for technical communicators topic refers to a small independent piece of information on a single subject. 



---------- 6.1. Building-block topics


 A topic is to a document what a subatomic particle (such as an electron) is to matter. It is the basic component in a document. Each topic can and must stand alone.

 Combinations of topics are like atoms. They form a section of a document containing a group of related topics. This corresponds to a book within an online help TOC, or a chapter within a book.

3. Groups of sections are like groups of atoms, or molecules, for example, a water molecule. These correspond to an entire document.

4. Groups of documents form a library, which is like the various molecules combined together to form the complex matter,

 Authors use building-block topics to assemble larger units of content. Readers should rarely see a building-block topic in isolation.

There are two ways to approach this: context-dependent and context-free:

Context-dependent building-block topics must be preceded by a lead-in topic and followed by a lead-out topic.

The other approach is to create context-free building-block topics. You can use context-free building-block topics in many different places. You still need to provide some context, but you don’t need to use a specific lead in and lead out. 


---------- 6.2. Presentational topics

A presentational topic is designed to be a unit of presentation. That is, it is intended to be the unit a reader receives. 

Some presentational topics are meant to be read, or at least navigated, in a particular order or hierarchy, which they depend on for some or all of their context.

------------ 6.3. Every Page is Page One topics

An Every Page is Page One topic is designed to establish its own context and to function independently. This does not mean that Every Page is Page One topics cannot belong to collections, but those collections will tend to be organized bottom up rather than top down.

it is not unusual to find help systems today that are a mix of Every Page is Page One topics, hierarchically dependent presentational topics, and even building-block topics presented on their own.

------------- 6.4. Economics and the evolution of topics

At one time, technical communicators wrote user guides as books and help systems as collections of presentational topics. Unfortunately, cost pressures made this approach unaffordable for many, and writers began using tools that created a help system by bursting the user guide at section boundaries.

Under these circumstances, it was perhaps inevitable that the word topic would come to mean a chunk of a book (though such a topic is usually neither a good building-block topic nor a good presentational topic).

------------ 6.5. DITA and Information Mapping

DITA [OASIS DITA TC] cemented this use of topic in the tech pubs lexicon. DITA was influenced by Information Mapping [Information Mapping], borrowing the idea that a document is a map connecting different types of content objects.

----------- 6.6. Topics and the Web

	    While all this was going on in the technical communication world, the Web was becoming the largest collection of Every Page is Page One topics anywhere.

 The Every Page is Page One topic is the natural and dominant form of topic on the Web.


What was almost entirely missing from the mass of topic-based tech comm that grew up on the Web was any contribution from anyone with the job title Technical Writer.

Today, therefore, there is considerable movement of professional tech comm into writing for the Web as a hypertext medium.

------------ 6.7. Every page is still page one even if the reader reads several

Saying that every page is page one is not saying that the page is the first page the reader has read today, nor that the reader will only read one page to complete one task. What it means is that every time a reader comes to a new topic, that topic operates as a new page one, just as when a reader puts down one book and picks up another, the first page of that new book is a new page one.

------------ 6.8. Characteristics of EPPO topics

The following chapters will detail the principal characteristics of Every Page is Page One topics:

-Self-contained

-Specific and limited purpose

-Conform to type

-Establish context

-Assume the reader is qualified: An EPPO topic assumes readers are qualified to complete the specific and limited purpose of a topic

-Stay on one level

-Link richly


------------ Chapter 7. EPPO Topics are Self-contained

There are several parts to this recipe: a title, introduction, picture, list of ingredients, directions, number served, and notes.

To function alone, the recipe needs all its parts. To be certain, some of the parts can be considered optional. The recipe does not need the picture to function, any more than your car needs heated seats to function. But the optional pieces, like the picture and the introduction, make the function more pleasant.

Whether a building-block approach is the best way to manage your content is outside the scope of this book. 
However, there’s no question that presenting the introduction, ingredients, and instructions separately is not useful to the reader. If you are going to manage those elements separately, for whatever purpose, you need to bring them back together before you present them to the reader.

------------ 7.1. Self-contained, not all alone

To say that a topic is self-contained is to say that it is not designed to work only as part of some larger information product. But neither is a topic expected to work in a complete information vacuum.

 The recipe does not depend on any one specific topic to ensure that the reader can learn to cook pasta. It relies on the whole information environment in which cooking occurs. Cooking is now an activity that takes place in the context of the Web.

Therefore a topic is self-contained not because it is entirely self-sufficient, but because it exists in a rich information environment that readers can call on to further their understanding.

------------ 7.2. The information scent of self-contained topics

Good information scent improves findability. Making sure your topics are self-contained will help give them the right scent.

There is nothing worse then following the scent of pizza into the lunch room only to find nothing left but crust. The scent of pizza hangs about the place. It even says pizza on the box, but there is no pizza here. Just crust. You leave frustrated and hungry.

A good EPPO topic that is self-contained represents a complete meal for a hungry information seeker.




Chapter 8. EPPO Topics have a Specific and Limited Purpose
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can only determine if a topic is self-contained if we know what purpose it is meant to fulfill. A topic needs a specific purpose.

------------  8.1. The scope of a topic

what is a good question? Tom suggests that it is “a relevant question within the user’s business scenario.” The user’s business scenario is the purpose that the user is attempting to achieve.

You will find many cases where the questioner has asked a vague and general question, or a highly specific but uncontextualized question, and one or more respondents have written back saying something such as “What are you trying to do?” Before providing an answer, they need to understand the questioner’s purpose. A question can only be answered properly in the context of a specific purpose. [17]

Before providing an answer, they need to understand the questioner’s purpose. A question can only be answered properly in the context of a specific purpose



------------ 8.2. Task-based writing

Writing a topic to serve a purpose for the reader is task-based writing. Task-based writing is commonly defined by contrasting it to feature-based writing: “Describe the user’s task, not the product’s features.”

In short, you can’t talk about the user’s task without talking about the user’s tools.

This is one reason documenting a new tool is such a challenge. Our tools shape our understanding of our tasks to such a degree that it is difficult to separate a task from the tool we currently use to accomplish that task.

One of the hardest things about moving technical writers from desktop publishing to structured writing is persuading them to give up responsibility for how the final output looks. Writers will keep looking for ways to specify layout, even in markup languages specifically designed to remove layout concerns. They understand their jobs in terms of the responsibilities their old tools imposed on them.

But even as tools change, users do not separate their purpose from their tools.


------------ 8.3. Derived purpose

Just as readers do not always express their queries in terms of their original motive, neither do they always express them in terms of their overall purpose. In many cases they express their queries in terms of what we might call a derived purpose.

Therefore, purpose cannot be divorced from features. What distinguishes task-orientation from feature-orientation in documentation is not what you call things, but what you choose to say about them.

------------ 8.4. Defining the purpose of a topic

In Example 7.1, “Tarragon Mac and Cheese Recipe” the specific and limited purpose is to show an experienced cook how to prepare Tarragon Mac and Cheese.

Example 8.1, “Outline of Using Themes for WordPress Codex” is the outline of the topic “Using Themes from the WordPress Codex.”

------------ 8.5. Topic purpose vs. user purpose

 The purpose of a topic is to serve the purpose of a reader. However, that does not mean that a single topic is a personalized expression of a particular individual reader’s entire purpose.

That is, your topics will need to work more like a bus service than a taxi service. They need to pick your readers up at a logical starting place and drop them off at a logical ending place, but they don’t need to go point-to-point from each reader’s home to each specific destination.


A well-designed information set is like a well-designed transportation system, it allows passengers to travel individual itineraries along shared routes.


------------ 8.6. Purpose and topic size

The key to finding the right size for an EPPO topic is to define the purpose correctly and then write a topic that fulfills that purpose. A focus on purpose forces you to scale each topic to a real need, giving the reader not only the action, but the reason and context for acting.


------------ 8.7. Decision support and the reader’s purpose

Providing the reason and context for acting is really another way of saying, “provide support for decision making.” One of the most important tools of modern business is the decision support system. Such systems can be complex, but at their heart, they simply provide people with the information they need to make decisions.

In technical communication, we don’t talk much about decision support; we talk about task support. We frame our jobs as providing the information people need to complete their tasks. Unfortunately, the information we provide is often simply a procedure for operating a machine. A task is not a procedure (a theme I’ll return to in Chapter 9, EPPO Topics Conform to a Type). In many cases, the information people need to complete their tasks is not information on how to operate machines, but information to support their decision making. It’s not “how do I push the button,” but “when and why should I push the button and what happens if I do.”


The real heart of technical instruction doesn’t lie in the step-by-step how-to information. It lies in understanding concepts and how they work together to produce an end. This focus on the conceptual interplay of the parts should drive the technical writing experience, both from a reader and writer’s point of view. Procedures are more like footnotes. As soon as the user understands the why and the what and the who and the where, the how is merely a mundane detail.

I’m not saying that you never need to document the physical procedure.  the details of command syntax have to be clearly documented. The same thing holds for other forms of documentation, too. But simply documenting procedures is never enough. Supporting the decisions users need to make, large and small, is the tough part.


letting users know what decisions they must make, making them aware of the consequences, and, as far as possible, leading them to resources and references that will assist them in deciding what to do. I’m talking about answering questions like:

Where are the valid values for this field listed?
What do each of the field values mean?
How will the system change as a result of this setting?
Does this setting form part of a collection of settings that are used to achieve an overall objective for the system.
What are the side effects of setting a particular value? Are there trade-offs on performance, access, or security as a result of changing this setting?
Should this setting match a value set elsewhere in the system? If so, which value, and which is the master and which is the slave?
Are there larger questions to consider before choosing the value for this setting?
Will the system validate this setting? How will I know if I have the right setting?
Does my choice for this setting depend on what other users have done, and, if so, what questions do I need to ask them before I change this setting?
Can I change this setting later, or will there be irrevocable consequences?
Could this setting result in loss of data or change how data is processed?
Who else might be affected by this setting, and what do I need to tell them so they can make good decisions about their own parts of the system?
How is this setting affected by optional components?

A good Every Page is Page One task topic should address these kinds of questions and should link richly to ancillary material the reader may need to help answer these questions. Only when the planning and decision-making aspects of the user’s task have be thoroughly covered should the topic proceed to the physical procedure for executing the decisions the user has made.





------------ 8.8. Purpose and findability


Keeping a topic to a single purpose is a huge aid to findability. People usually have a specific and limited purpose when they search.

When people search the Web, they are looking for content that meets their specific and limited purpose. A good EPPO topic that meets that specific and limited purpose will give them what they want. And because it is specifically written to that specific and limited purpose, it will smell like what they are looking for. And because it does what it claims to do, it will be filtered in by search engines and social curators.






Chapter 9. EPPO Topics Conform to a Type
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A topic type is a plan or a prescription for a topic. It tells the writer how the topic should be written and the reader how it should be read. A topic type defines the content, order, and form of a topic.

Good Every Page is Page One topics frequently share a clear topic type with other topics that have a similar purpose.

Conforming to a type is the principal way in which we ensure that an EPPO topic meets its specific and limited purpose. But more than that, conformance to a type helps the content smell right.

A recipe or an API reference could be written to contain the same information without following the conventions for its type, but then it would not look or smell like a recipe or an API reference. Readers might arrive at the topic and not recognize that it contains the information they want, simply because it doesn’t look like what they expected.

Topic type is determined by the information needed to fulfill a purpose, not by its visual appearance. A visual layout that reflects the type usually helps the reader, but it is the type that is the master and the layout the slave, not the other way round.

Many other topics in Wikipedia have similarly well-defined topic types: vehicles, languages, flora, fauna, novels, and on and on. Simply browsing Wikipedia is an effective short course on topic typing. Once again, no standards committee established these topic types. Rather, they are the result of thousands of contributors gradually building up topics, filling in gaps, and refactoring and refining the structure.

When it comes to topics, adherence to a type is the norm, not the exception. Find a topic that does not seem to have a type or does not conform to the common structure of topics with a similar purpose, and you will almost always discover that that topic has strayed from its purpose or never had a well-defined purpose.




------------ 9.2. Discovering and defining topic types

Topic types are a reflection and a formalization of the specific and limited purpose of topics. Therefore, defining explicit topic types begins by exploring what is needed to fulfill the topic’s purpose.

Because topic types fall naturally out of the specific and limited purpose of a topic, you might think your topics will naturally fall into types without any attempt to explicitly think about the topic type. Unfortunately, it’s not that easy.

Creating topic types is a two-part effort of discovering existing topic types and then using your discoveries to define the topic types you need. Once you do that, you will want to document your topic types and set up your authoring environment to support them. The best way to do that is through structured writing (Ch. 18).

---- 9.2.1. Discovering topic types

One of the most effective ways to discover topic types is by looking at existing topics designed to serve the same purpose. You can look on the Web, in your competitor’s documentation, and in your own existing documentation. Make a collection of diverse sources and make lists of the repeating fields and sections that you find in each sample.

Remember when you do this ... You are looking for the limited set of specific pieces of information required to meet the user need this topic is designed to fulfill.


---- 9.2.2. Defining topic types

Once you have done your research, it is time to create your topic definition. Now is the time to get specific.

An API reference doesn’t just contain a line of code. It contains a function signature, and that function signature has a particular format that all programmers understand:

[return type]? [function name] [[parameter name] [parameter type]]…
Even when topics naturally conform to a type, individual authors may implement that type with a different organization and different inclusions and exclusions. For a systematic authoring project, you need create a stricter definition of each topic type to ensure consistency and completeness.

What is most important is to make sure you capture the information a topic needs to have to serve its purpose.

To do this, you need to start with the specific and limited purpose you have defined for each topic type. What information must each topic include to achieve its specific and limited purpose? What information does a user need?

Stay focused on the specific and limited purpose. It is easy to start imagining all kinds of things a hypothetical user might want to know. By all means keep a list of these things, because they may be clues to other topic types you need, but don’t let them creep into your topic type definition.


---- 9.2.3. Handling optional material

You can have optional parts in your topic type, but you should only include them if they are sufficiently related to the topic’s purpose.

---- 9.2.4. Serving the commercial purpose

Ultimately, every part of a topic type definition needs to serve either the reader, the publisher, or (preferably) both.



------------ 9.3. Concept, task, and reference reconsidered

It has become an axiom of technical communications in the last few years that all content falls into one of three types: concept, task, or reference. However, EPPO topic types are more specific and varied than this simple trio. 

------ 9.3.1. The origins of concept, task, and reference

The concept, task, reference trio originates with DITA’s adoption of these three types,

The problem is that, in the popular conception, the words concept, task, and reference have been reduced to shapes.

We have somehow gone from the laudable idea that users want information that helps them perform a specific task (as opposed to information that simply described the machine) to presenting single procedures by themselves.

This is certainly not the approach advocated in Information Mapping.  

If there is a problem with DITA, it is not that it lacks a theory of information design, but rather that many people believe that DITA’s concept/task/reference trio is a theory of information design.

The result is that when you talk about topic types today, people’s minds go at once to the DITA trio. For EPPO, that’s a problem because a typical EPPO topic has a much more specific type definition, which may contain several different types of information blocks. It is important, therefore, to spend some time looking at why the trio of concept/task/reference, though useful for some purposes, is not sufficient either as a set of topic types or as a principle of information design.


------ 9.3.2. A task is not a procedure



------9.3.3. A reference is more than a topic



------ 9.3.4. Everything else is not a concept

 there are plenty of topic types that are not, by any reasonable definition, either tasks or references, nor are they big-C concepts. And they aren’t generic either. An example from my background writing about programming languages and operating systems is the annotated code-sample topic.

Programmers want two things above all else in a documentation set: a thorough API reference and working code samples.

There are many topic types that don’t fall into the task or reference categories, but only one qualifies as a true concept. Concept is not the right word to describe “everything else.” And it isn’t useful to single out tasks and references as particular types and then assign everything else to a single category, however you name that category. To do so is akin to dividing the animal kingdom into cats, dogs, and everything else.

This is certainly not the approach advocated in Information Mapping.
