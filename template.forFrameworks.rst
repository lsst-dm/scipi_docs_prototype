#######################
Template For Frameworks
#######################

The title of the framework’s topic is simply the name of the framework itself.


Context
=======

A context paragraph establishes what the framework is for, and what the framework’s primary features or capabilities are.


In depth
========

This section provides a table of contents for additional topics that cover individual framework concepts. Concept topics can include guides for developing against the framework, and descriptions of the basic ideas implemented by the framework. ‘Concept‘ is purposefully ambiguous but we require that concept topic pages follow the design principles of topic-based documentation.

Generally, the first topic should be an overview. The overview topic’s narrative introduces and links to other framework topics.

Tutorials
=========

The Tutorials section provides a table of contents linking to separate tutorial topic pages. 

Modules
=======

This section lists and links to the module topic of all modules included in a framework.


Framework topic type extensibility
==================================

The components described above are a minimum set used by each framework topic. Some frameworks may add additional components.
